# Tile Puzzle
simple classic games

# Introduction:
This is a beta version of classic tile puzzle game.
It includes an algorithm to solve the puzzle automatically, also there're three themes available.
As this is my first try of making UI with QT, there might be some bugs and shortcomings.

# Current Goal:
-Fix bug: When pressing the other buttons while the puzzle is auto solving, the application will crash.
-Optimize UI: Make the background and button stretch to the optimal size when resizing the window.
-Adding extra choices: Add 4x4, 5x5, 6x6 options to the game.
-Adding solution: Add 4x4,5x5,6x6 solution to the game.
-Cumtomized puzzle: user can upload picture for the puzzle.
